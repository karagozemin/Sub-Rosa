# Deploy & environment variables

Sub Rosa **does not require a committed `.env` file**. Secrets stay out of git; you inject them where each layer runs.

## Three layers

| Layer | Needs env? | When vars are read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hosted pilot UI** (`apps/web`) | Optional | **Build time** (`VITE_*` baked into static JS) |
| **Keeper / appraisal API** | Yes (secrets) | **Runtime** (shell, systemd, Fly/Railway secrets) |
| **One-off scripts** (deploy, e2e) | Yes | **Runtime** (inline `VAR=… command` or CI secrets) |

---

## 1. Hosted pilot UI - ship without any env

The demo works from **embedded `DEMO_TRACE`** (`demo-trace.generated.ts` from `pnpm agents:e2e`). No `.env` needed.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm web:build
# static output → apps/web/dist
```

Host `dist/` on Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, S3, etc.

**Build settings (generic):**

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Install | `pnpm install` |
| Build | `pnpm web:build` |
| Output directory | `apps/web/dist` |
| Node | 22+ |

---

## 2. Hosted pilot UI - optional live contract poll

Only if you want **“Poll live contract”** on the deployed site, set these **before `pnpm web:build`** in the hosting UI (Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables, etc.).

Copy from `apps/web/.env.example`:

```bash
VITE_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
VITE_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
VITE_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
VITE_CONTRACT_ID=CCOVGOQQZJKZ2R55GRWBLTJTGBAMSHXZVN3ICPG3WRVMLMM6RHISC5OV
```

**Core v2 mainnet example**:

```bash
VITE_STELLAR_NETWORK=mainnet
VITE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.sorobanrpc.com
VITE_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015"
VITE_CONTRACT_ID=CDQOFNCJE5Z4ZZL76DU5652FOUKJVEIZWHFGCZVWH63UYBGPSZIPC325
VITE_ROUND_ID=1
```

Do not use the legacy v1 mainnet proof as the Core v2 UI contract. Named
network configuration validates this boundary at build time.

Important: Vite only exposes vars prefixed with `VITE_`. They are **public** in the browser bundle — never put secret keys here.

### Local dev (optional)

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
# edit VITE_* then:
pnpm web:dev
```

`.env.local` is gitignored; not required for production.

---

## 3. Keeper watch mode (runtime secrets)

Runs on a server/VM, not in the static site. No `.env` file required — export vars in the process manager:

```bash
export KEEPER_SECRET="S…"
export STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
export WATCH_POLL_MS=15000
export WATCH_ROUND_IDS=1

pnpm keeper:watch
```

Or one line:

```bash
KEEPER_SECRET=S… ROUND_CONTRACT_ID=C… pnpm keeper:watch
```

For a read-only preflight of one round, no signing secret is required:

```bash
KEEPER_DRY_RUN=true ROUND_CONTRACT_ID=C… ROUND_ID=1 pnpm --filter @sub-rosa/keeper start
```

The command prints a structured JSON summary with the round status, Drand
round, bidder/revealed counts, current phase, and next action. It exits without
submitting open, reveal, clear, settle, or void transactions.

On Fly.io / Railway / GitHub Actions: put the same names in **Secrets**, not in the web build.

See root `.env.example` for the full keeper variable list.

---

## 4. Deploy & settle scripts (runtime, inline)

Scripts read env at invocation — no `.env` file on disk:

```bash
pnpm mainnet:v2:prepare # local/read-only; sends no transaction

MAINNET_CONFIRM=SUB_ROSA_MAINNET OPERATOR_IDENTITY=sub-rosa-mainnet-v2-operator \
  pnpm mainnet:v2:deploy

MAINNET_CONFIRM=SUB_ROSA_MAINNET \
  OPERATOR_IDENTITY=sub-rosa-mainnet-v2-operator \
  BIDDER_IDENTITY=sub-rosa-mainnet-v2-bidder \
  ROUND_CONTRACT_ID=C… pnpm mainnet:v2:smoke -- --execute
```

The named identities can be generated with `stellar keys generate NAME
--secure-store`. Secure-store identities intentionally do not reveal an `S...`
secret; these scripts ask Stellar CLI to sign with the Keychain identity
directly. Headless CI may use `OPERATOR_SECRET` and `BIDDER_SECRET` instead,
but each role must set exactly one identity or secret source.

```bash
# Headless CI alternative; inject these from the CI secret store.
OPERATOR_SECRET=S…
BIDDER_SECRET=S…
```

The deployer pays the WASM upload and deployment fees. During the capped smoke,
the seller/operator pays create and lifecycle calls while the bidder pays its
commit. The SDK never charges these fees to a Sub Rosa-owned account. Escrow
and the auction lot are separate from network fees.

E2E scripts (`lifecycle:e2e`, `agents:e2e`) generate ephemeral keys via Stellar CLI — they do not need a root `.env` either.

---

## 5. Appraisal API (if you host it)

Runtime env for `pnpm appraisal:start`:

| Var | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `FACILITATOR_SECRET` | Signs/submits x402 settle txs |
| `PAY_TO` / server key | Receives USDC |
| `X402_NETWORK` | `stellar:testnet` (default) or `stellar:pubnet` |
| `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` | Optional; when set, must match `X402_NETWORK` |
| `RPC_URL` | Soroban RPC; required for pubnet |
| `PAYMENT_ASSET` | SEP-41 contract; defaults to USDC for the selected network |
| `PRICE` | Appraisal price (default 0.10) |
| `PORT` | HTTP port (default 4021) |

Minimal local/testnet configuration:

```bash
export FACILITATOR_SECRET="S…"
export PAY_TO="G…"
export X402_NETWORK="stellar:testnet"
export NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

pnpm appraisal:start
```

Testnet defaults to the canonical testnet USDC contract, Soroban testnet RPC,
price `0.10`, and port `4021`. For pubnet, set
`X402_NETWORK=stellar:pubnet`, the public-network passphrase, and an explicit
`RPC_URL`; the default payment asset then changes to pubnet USDC.

Configuration errors fail before the HTTP server starts and name the affected
variable, for example:

```text
FACILITATOR_SECRET: missing required env var
PRICE: must be a finite number greater than 0
X402_NETWORK: unsupported network "stellar:mainnet"
NETWORK_PASSPHRASE: does not match X402_NETWORK=stellar:testnet
RPC_URL: is required when X402_NETWORK=stellar:pubnet
```

Agents point at the public URL via `X402_APPRAISAL_URL` — not baked into the web UI.

---

## Quick decision tree

```
Shipping the hosted pilot UI only?
  → pnpm web:build, upload dist/, no env

Want live on-chain overlay on the site?
  → set VITE_* in hosting build env, then build

Running keeper 24/7?
  → KEEPER_SECRET + ROUND_CONTRACT_ID on the server (runtime)

Deploying new contract round?
  → mainnet:v2:prepare first; funded signers only for deploy/smoke execution
```

## Mainnet scripts

```bash
pnpm mainnet:v2:prepare           # build/hash/bindings; 0 transactions
ROUND_CONTRACT_ID=C… pnpm mainnet:v2:smoke -- --dry-run
MAINNET_CONFIRM=SUB_ROSA_MAINNET OPERATOR_IDENTITY=sub-rosa-mainnet-v2-operator \
  pnpm mainnet:v2:deploy          # funded deployment
MAINNET_CONFIRM=SUB_ROSA_MAINNET \
  OPERATOR_IDENTITY=sub-rosa-mainnet-v2-operator \
  BIDDER_IDENTITY=sub-rosa-mainnet-v2-bidder \
  ROUND_CONTRACT_ID=C… pnpm mainnet:v2:smoke -- --execute
```

After deployment, verify the exact on-chain WASM before executing the smoke:

```bash
ROUND_CONTRACT_ID=CDQOFNCJE5Z4ZZL76DU5652FOUKJVEIZWHFGCZVWH63UYBGPSZIPC325 pnpm mainnet:v2:verify
```

The historical `mainnet:ready`, `mainnet:verify`, `mainnet:micro`, and
`mainnet:settle` commands target the frozen legacy v1 proof. They are retained
for backward compatibility. Prefer the explicit `mainnet:legacy:ready`,
`mainnet:legacy:verify`, `mainnet:legacy:micro`, and `mainnet:legacy:settle`
names for historical evidence; they are not the Core v2 launch path.

### Mainnet launch checklist

1. Run `pnpm mainnet:v2:prepare`; require the built hash to match the testnet-reviewed Core v2 WASM.
2. Fund separate mainnet operator and bidder accounts. Keep values capped.
3. Deploy only with `MAINNET_CONFIRM=SUB_ROSA_MAINNET` and preserve the local deployment artifact.
4. Set the resulting Core v2 `ROUND_CONTRACT_ID`, run the secrets-free
   `pnpm mainnet:v2:verify`, then run the smoke dry-run.
5. Execute the capped lifecycle and publish the six transaction links plus verified receipt.
6. Promote the address into `SUB_ROSA_DEPLOYMENTS.mainnet` only after independent review of the artifact and evidence.

## Security

- **Never** commit `.env` with secrets (already in `.gitignore`).
- **Never** put `S…` secret keys in `VITE_*` — they end up in public JS.
- Rotate any key that was pasted in chat or logs.

## Owner-Triggered Reveal (protocol 3 — testnet)

The versioned opening policy and corrected Drand timing are implemented and
deployed to a **separate testnet contract** with live value-moving proofs
recorded (2026-09-18). Existing SDK/UI deployment **defaults remain unchanged**:
they keep resolving to the reviewed Core v2 contract, and the v3 testnet contract
is reached only via an explicit contract ID. Mainnet deployment and default
promotion remain pending an independent funds-handling review.

Testnet v3 contract (non-default; opt in explicitly):

```bash
VITE_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
VITE_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
VITE_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
VITE_CONTRACT_ID=CB7VIYY4RQLZG2Y6HLDWB3UKSVOAIDYFZ5TGW5AUBCIPJHTCZV4ZWQFF
```

On-chain WASM hash matches `7a72a82c…b194` and `protocol_version()` advertises
capability 3. Evidence: `artifacts/reveal-policy-v3/testnet/deployment.json` and
`lifecycle.json`. See [reveal policy and rollout plan](REVEAL_POLICY.md) for
authorization, fallback, receipt compatibility and the remaining rollout steps.
